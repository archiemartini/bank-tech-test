# Bank Tech Test

Entering my tenth week at Makers, I've been set a multitude of challenges set to sharpen and challenge my Object Oriented Design and Test Driven Development skills.

For more information on the acceptance criteria for this task see './bank_tech_test.md'.

## Installation

- clone this repository to your local machine
- run `npm install`
- load 'nodetest.js' in node to set up a feature test
- test with `jest`

The programme allows you to deposit/withdraw from the bank class. For testing purposes you can enter a date in this format 'dd/mm/yyyy', as a second argument after the deposit/withdrawal amount. Otherwise the argument will default and call the date today.

## Usage
